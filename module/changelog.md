**Key Highlights:**

*   🚀 **Complete Refactoring:** TEESimulator v2.0 has been entirely rebuilt and is no longer based on its predecessors, [TrickyStore](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore) and [TrickyStoreOSS](https://github.com/beakthoven/TrickyStoreOSS), resulting in a more streamlined and maintainable codebase.

*   🛡️ **Enhanced Bypass Capabilities:** The simulator now successfully bypasses well-known detection mechanisms, including [TamperedAttestation](https://github.com/JingMatrix/TamperedAttestation) and [KeyAttestation](https://github.com/JingMatrix/KeyAttestation).

*   💳 **Revolut Detection Bypass:** With a valid keybox, users can now circumvent the detection measures implemented in the [Revolut](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.revolut.revolut) application.

**Current Limitations:**

*   ⚠️ **Google Play Verdict:** Bypassing the detections within the Google Play verdict remains an unresolved challenge. We are actively seeking solutions and welcome any insights from the community regarding potential system module-based bypasses.

**Platform Support:**

*   📱 **Android 10 & 11:** TEESimulator v2.0 has not yet been tested on Android 10 or 11. We encourage users on these platforms to report any issues and provide logs to help us improve compatibility.

**Contributing:**

*   🤝 We welcome and encourage community contributions. Please feel free to submit issues and pull requests to help improve the project.
